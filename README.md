# Analytic Theory of Dropout Regularization

This repository contains the two Mathematica notebooks for the paper “An analytic theory of dropout regularization” (April 23, 2025).

## Notebooks

- **Plateau_perturbative.nb**   
  - First-order (η) correction to the plateau phase

- **Plateau_stability_complete.nb**  
  - Fixed-point analysis of the unspecialized (plateau) phase  
  - Linear stability calculation for the specialization transition

## Requirements

- Mathematica 12 or later

## Usage

Adjust parameters (`K`, `M`, `η`, `σ`, `r`) in input cells to explore different regimes.
